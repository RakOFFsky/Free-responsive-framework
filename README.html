<p>I developed most often meeting elements of design and I adapted them under mobile devices. All components of library conform to the W3C standard. Components don&#39;t depend from each other. All animations of components are made by means of CSS 3 that removes dependence on js-library. One of advantages of a framework is a minimalist in a code. The second advantage is a fast start and convenience of use.</p>
